Please make a personal website for me.

My name is Le. I like programming and games. Also skiing, songwriting, basketball and tennis.

**Visual theme I want**
- Dark theme with neon accents (cyan/purple)
- Subtle particles / lines background with animation
- Smooth section reveal on scroll
- Cards with hover glow, buttons with hover/active states
- Prefer modern, clean typography

**Content sections**
- Hero header with name and one-line tagline
- About me: 4–6 sentences
- Skills: languages, engines, specialties (grid/cards)
- Projects: at least 3 items, each with title, short desc, and small “tech tags”
- Footer: simple links (GitHub / LinkedIn / Email)

**Strong requirements**
- Please create the **main website in `index.html`** (do not change this filename).
- The site should be **purely static** (no API tests).
- There is already **UI tests in `tests/ui.test.js`**, please run these when files are ready.
- If you add more tests, please put them in the `tests/` folder.

**Style/UX**
- CSS effects, animations, and hover effects are required.
- Keep good contrast and accessibility (legible text sizes).
- Responsive layout (desktop and mobile).
